```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Easy.
__10E1.__ If an event has probability 0.35, what are the log-odds of this event?
```{r}
log( 0.35 / (1 - 0.35))
```

__10E2.__ If an event  has log-odds 3.2, what is the probabiity of this event?
```{r}
1 / (1 + exp(-3.2))
```

__10E3.__ A coefficient in a logistic regression has value 1.7. What does this imply about the proportional change in odds of the outcome?
```{r}
exp(1.7)
```

For a change from 0 to 1 in variable for this coefficient would mean that there would be a proportional increase of 5.47 in the odds of the outcome. That is, the odds would increase by 447%.

__10E4.__ Why do Poisson regressions sometimes require the use of an _offset_?
If the measurements are over different time intervals then an offset is necessary to align all observations with each other.
